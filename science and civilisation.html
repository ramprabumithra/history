    <h2>ENGLAND</h2>
    <p>The earliest known humans arrived in these lands around 900,000 years ago. Prehistory stretches from then until the Roman invasion in AD 43. In the hundreds of thousands of years before history began, these lands underwent huge climactic, societal, political, technological and geological changes. </p>
	<br>
	<p>The Romans stayed in Britain for almost four centuries. In some parts of the country they were met with rebellion and resistance, but in more peaceful areas cities were founded, villas constructed and a network of roads developed that can still be traced today. And in AD 122, the emperor Hadrian, visiting Britain, ordered the building of his famous wall.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The six and a half centuries between the end of Roman rule and the Norman Conquest are among the most important in English history. This long period is also one of the most challenging to understand – which is why it has traditionally been labelled the ‘Dark Ages’.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Duke William of Normandy’s resounding triumph over King Harold at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 marked the dawn of a new era. The overthrow of the Saxon kingdom of England was to transform the country the Normans conquered, from how it was organised and governed to its language and customs – and perhaps most visibly today, its architecture.This was also a period of upheaval and change, a time of revolt, civil war, devastating plague and royal unrest. </p>
	<br>
	<p>Henry VII’s victory against Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth ended the turbulent Wars of the Roses and began the Tudor dynasty – possibly the most famous royal family in English history. The country underwent huge changes during the reigns of three generations of Tudor monarchs. Henry VIII ushered in a new state religion, and the increasing confidence of the state coincided with the growth of a distinctively English culture. </p>
	<br>
	<p>The Stuart era began when James I, who was also James VI of Scotland, succeded Elizabeth I. She had died childless in 1603. James's ascention to the throne brought together the the two long-warring nations of England and Scotland.The Stuart period witnessed intense religious and political conflicts, which shifted power from the monarchy to parliament. Meanwhile, discoveries and innovations transformed science, architecture and everyday life.</p>
	<br>
	<p>When Queen Anne died in 1714 with no surviving children, the German Hanoverians were brought in to succeed her. This began the Georgian age – named after the first four Hanovarian kings, all called George.This period saw Britain establish itself as an international power at the centre of an expanding empire, and accelerating change from the 1770s onwards made it the world’s first industrialised nation.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Queen Victoria came to the throne when she was just 18 years old. She would rule Britain for over 60 years. During this long reign, the country acquired unprecedented power and wealth. Britain’s reach extended across the globe because of its empire, political stability, and revolutionary developments in transport and communication.Many of the intellectual and cultural achievements of this period are still with us today.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The Britain of the year 2000 was unimaginable at the end of the Victorian era in 1901.The 20th century saw two world wars catalyse enormous social change across the country, including dramatic enhancements in health and education. The motor car stormed through town and country, transforming both, and Britain no longer ruled a third of the planet.</p>
	<br>
	<p>In the heart of England stands the Queen, tea, fish and chips and magnanimous scientific epiphanies. Some of its greatest benefactors are:
	<ul type="circle">
	<li>Sir Isaac Newton is not just one of the great British scientists, but he’s also one of the most prominent scientists ever to have walked this planet. A true polymath, the Lincolnshire-born Newton was an expert mathematician, physicist, astronomer, and alchemist.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Few people on this list have had an impact as profound as the 19th-century naturalist, geologist, and biologist, Charles Darwin. Breaking with almost two millennia of deeply entrenched religious dogma, Darwin's theory of evolution would radically alter our understanding of humanity's place within nature.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Many people cite another British great, Alan Turing, as the creator of the computer. But without the work of Ada Lovelace, it might not have been possible. In the socially conservative Victorian era, Lovelace was years ahead of her time.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Another Nobel Prize winner — this time in 1945 — Alexander Fleming had an impact that would transcend science. Born in Ayrshire in 1881, Fleming’s great discovery came when he was studying influenza in 1928 — almost a decade after returning from service in the First World War.</li>
	<br>
	<li>As the only British woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, it’s perhaps not surprising to see Dorothy Hodgkin’s name on a list of the greatest British scientists. Though born in Egypt, she was raised and educated in the UK.  Hodgkin’s prolific career was full of incredible scientific discoveries. In 1945, she discovered the atomic structure of penicillin.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Many consider Rosalind Franklin’s emission from the rollcall of Nobel Prize winners as a blemish on the prize’s record. Franklin, a British biophysicist and X-ray crystallographer, made hugely important and influential contributions to our understanding of the molecular structures of DNA.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Simply put, the theoretical physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking was one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century and arguably one of the greatest thinkers of all time.</li></ul>

    <h2>INDIA</h2>
	<p>There were activities of proto-humans (Homo erectus) in the Indian subcontinent 20 lakh years (2 million years) ago, and of Homo sapiens since 70,000 BC. But they were gathers/hunters.The first inhabitants of Indian subcontinent might have been tribals like Nagas (North-East), Santhals (East-India), Bhils (Central India), Gonds (Central India), Todas (South India) etc. Most of them are speakers of the Austric, pre-Dravidian languages, such as Munda and Gondvi. Dravidians and Aryans are believed to be immigrants who came later to the sub-continent.</p>
	<br>
    <p>The Mature Indus civilization flourished from about 2600 to 1900 BCE, marking the beginning of urban civilization on the Indian subcontinent. The civilization included cities such as Harappa, Ganeriwala, and Mohenjo-daro in modern-day Pakistan, and Dholavira, Kalibangan, Rakhigarhi, and Lothal in modern-day India.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The Vedic period is the period when the Vedas were composed, the liturgical hymns from the Indo-Aryan people. The Vedic culture was located in part of north-west India, while other parts of India had a distinct cultural identity during this period. The Vedic culture is described in the texts of Vedas, still sacred to Hindus, which were orally composed and transmitted in Vedic Sanskrit. The Vedas are some of the oldest extant texts in India. The Vedic period, lasting from about 1500 to 500 BCE(Although this stands disputed), contributed the foundations of several cultural aspects of the Indian subcontinent. In terms of culture, many regions of the Indian subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic to the Iron Age in this period</p>
	<br>
	<p>The Iron Age in the Indian subcontinent from about 1200 BCE to the 6th century BCE is defined by the rise of Janapadas, which are realms, republics and kingdoms—notably the Iron Age Kingdoms of Kuru, Panchala, Kosala, Videha.</P>
	<br>
	<p>During the time between 800 and 200 BCE the Śramaṇa movement formed, from which originated Jainism and Buddhism. In the same period, the first Upanishads were written. After 500 BCE, the so-called "second urbanisation" started, with new urban settlements arising at the Ganges plain, especially the Central Ganges plain</p>
	<br>
	<p>The time between the Maurya Empire in the 3rd century BCE and the end of the Gupta Empire in the 6th century CE is referred to as the "Classical" period of India.It can be divided in various sub-periods, depending on the chosen periodisation. Classical period begins after the decline of the Maurya Empire, and the corresponding rise of the Shunga dynasty and Satavahana dynasty. The Gupta Empire (4th–6th century) is regarded as the "Golden Age" of Hinduism, although a host of kingdoms ruled over India in these centuries. Also, the Sangam literature flourished from the 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century CE in southern India. During this period, India's economy is estimated to have been the largest in the world, having between one-third and one-quarter of the world's wealth, from 1 CE to 1000 CE.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The late medieval period is marked by repeated invasions of the Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, the rule of the Delhi sultanate, and by the growth of other dynasties and empires, built upon military technology of the Sultanate.In the early 18th century the Maratha Empire extended suzerainty over the Indian subcontinent. Under the Peshwas, the Marathas consolidated and ruled over much of South Asia. The Marathas are credited to a large extent for ending Mughal rule in India.</p>
	<br>
	<p>In 1498, a Portuguese fleet under Vasco da Gama successfully discovered a new sea route from Europe to India, which paved the way for direct Indo-European commerce. The Portuguese soon set up trading posts in Goa, Daman, Diu and Bombay. After their conquest in Goa, the Portuguese instituted the Goa Inquisition, where new Indian converts and non-Christians were punished for suspected heresy against Christianity and were condemned to be burnt. Goa became the main Portuguese base until it was annexed by India in 1961.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The English East India Company was founded in 1600 as The Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East Indies. It gained a foothold in India with the establishment of a factory in Masulipatnam on the Eastern coast of India in 1611 and a grant of rights by the Mughal emperor Jahangir to establish a factory in Surat in 1612. The Indian rebellion of 1857 was a large-scale rebellion by soldiers employed by the British East India Company in northern and central India against the company's rule. The spark that led to the mutiny was the issue of new gunpowder cartridges for the Enfield rifle, which was insensitive to local religious prohibition. The key mutineer was Mangal Pandey.During Company rule in India and the British Raj, famines in India were some of the worst ever recorded. These famines, often resulting from crop failures due to El Niño which were exacerbated by the destructive policies of the colonial government</p>
    <br>
	<p>In August 1947, the British Indian Empire was partitioned into the Union of India and Dominion of Pakistan. In particular, the partition of Punjab and Bengal led to rioting between Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs in these provinces and spread to other nearby regions, leaving some 500,000 dead. The police and army units were largely ineffective. The British officers were gone, and the units were beginning to tolerate if not actually indulge in violence against their religious enemies</p>
    <br>
	<p>The rich heritage of India, one of the world's oldest civilizations, is an all-embracing confluence of religions, traditions and customs. The highlights of Indian heritage lie in the treasure of its art, architecture, classical dance, music, flora and fauna, and the innate secular philosophy of its people.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The scientific contributions of India have been bountiless,some of her most prolific contemporary scientists are:

    <h2>EGYPT</h2>
	
    <p>Though there is evidence of settlers along the Nile River dating from almost 120,000 years ago, the history of ancient Egypt is generally divided into three major periods of stability: the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, and the New Kingdom. These were separated by intermediate periods of political instability and followed by the Late Period.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The Old Kingdom, beginning in the 3rd millennium BCE is considered Egypt’s first great period of prosperity and political stability. The pharaohs of the Old Kingdom, assisted by a system of efficient administrators, commissioned a number of large-scale irrigation projects which led to surpluses in food and commerce. They also created a bureaucracy responsible for collecting taxes and administering a sophisticated justice system, and they commissioned a number of pyramids and other large-scale building projects. The Old Kingdom ended c. 2200 BCE after a series of droughts and political strife that led to the collapse of Egypt’s government.</p>
    <br>
	<p>Following nearly two centuries of political stagnation and economic instability known as the First Intermediate Period, Egypt’s Middle Kingdom marks another period of great prosperity. Beginning around 2030 BCE, the pharaohs of the eleventh dynasty, following a series of successful military campaigns to secure their power, promoted irrigation projects around the Nile that created great economic prosperity. Along with this prosperity and greater disbursement of wealth, high-ranking Egyptians outside the pharaoh’s immediate family demanded access to the afterlife. As a result, a number of Egyptian nobles and priests were mummified and entombed during the period. The Middle Kingdom ended around 1650 BCE after a series of insufficient crops weakened the power of the pharaoh.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The Second Intermediate Period, marked by a series of weak and foreign rulers, was followed by Egypt’s New Kingdom. New Kingdom pharaohs ushered in a period of prosperity by promoting diplomatic alliances with their neighbors. The New Kingdom ended after a series of military defeats and internal unrest that weakened the power of the pharaoh, who was replaced by the growing power of the priesthood.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The Third Intermediate Period was another period characterized by foreign rulers, wars, and political strife. It was followed by the Late Period when Egypt served as a vassal to several different foreign rulers, alike the Ptolemaic dynasty.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Egypt has a rich history and culture dating back thousands of years, starting with the Pharaonic culture, then Christianity and Islam. Egypt is among the earliest civilizations. Its culture has been affected by many other cultures and ethnic groups who either lived in or invaded the country, creating a melting pot.</p>
	<br>
	<p>They were the first to introduce mummification, medicine, agriculture, fermentation, engineering and architecture. The ancient Egyptians were pioneers in astronomy: their expertise played an important role in determining the annual flooding of the Nile, and aligning the pyramids towards the pole star.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Greek inventor and mathematician Hero of Alexandria is remembered for his iconic work on geometry, Metrica, which was lost for many years but was then discovered after 1896. His most significant contributions include the Heron’s formula to find the area of a triangle, the Hero engine, and a wind-harnessing machine.
	In the tenth century, Ibn Al-Haytham founded the science of optics, and in the 13th century, the physician Ibn Al-Nafis discovered how blood circulates in the body. In the modern era, Moustafa Mosharafa, the Egyptian theoretical physicist, contributed to the development of Einstein’s quantum theory. Today, Sir Magdi Yacoub, a professor of cardiothoracic surgery at Imperial College London, is considered one of the world's top surgeons in heart transplantation. The success of these Egyptian scientists, who have all benefited humanity with their contributions to science, has had a great impact on attitudes to innovation in Egyptian culture.</p>

    <h2>ROME</h2>
    <p>In historiography, ancient Rome describes Roman civilization from the founding of the Italian city of Rome in the 8th century BC to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD, in turn encompassing the Roman Kingdom (753–509 BC), Roman Republic (509–27 BC) and Roman Empire (27 BC–476 AD) until the fall of the western empire.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Rome was founded around 625 BC in the areas of ancient Italy known as Etruria and Latium. It is thought that the city-state of Rome was initially formed by Latium villagers joining together with settlers from the surrounding hills in response to an Etruscan invasion. It is unclear whether they came together in defense or as a result of being brought under Etruscan rule. Archaeological evidence indicates that a great deal of change and unification took place around 600 BC which likely led to the establishment of Rome as a true city.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The first period in Roman history is known as the Period of Kings, and it lasted from Rome’s founding until 510 BC. During this brief time Rome, led by no fewer than six kings, advanced both militaristically and economically with increases in physical boundaries, military might, and production and trade of goods including oil lamps. Politically, this period saw the early formation of the Roman constitution. The end of the Period of Kings came with the decline of Etruscan power, thus ushering in Rome’s Republican Period.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Rome entered its Republican Period in 510 BC. No longer ruled by kings, the Romans established a new form of government whereby the upper classes ruled, namely the senators and the equestrians, or knights. However, a dictator could be nominated in times of crisis. In 451 BC, the Romans established the “Twelve Tables,” a standardized code of laws meant for public, private, and political matters.By 51 BC, Julius Caesar had conquered Celtic Gaul and, for the first time, Rome’s borders had spread beyond the Mediterranean region. Although the Senate was still Rome’s governing body, its power was weakening. Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC and replaced by his heir, Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus (Octavian) who ruled alongside Mark Antony. In 31 BC Rome overtook Egypt which resulted in the death of Mark Antony and left Octavian as the unchallenged ruler of Rome. Octavian assumed the title of Augustus and thus became the first emperor of Rome.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Rome’s Imperial Period was its last, beginning with the rise of Rome’s first emperor in 31 BC and lasting until the fall of Rome in AD 476. During this period, Rome saw several decades of peace, prosperity, and expansion. By AD 117, the Roman Empire had reached its maximum extant, spanning three continents including Asia Minor, northern Africa, and most of Europe.In AD 286 the Roman Empire was split into eastern and western empires, each ruled by its own emperor. The western empire suffered several Gothic invasions and, in AD 455, was sacked by Vandals. Rome continued to decline after that until AD 476 when the western Roman Empire came to an end. The eastern Roman Empire, more commonly known as the Byzantine Empire, survived until the 15th century AD. It fell when Turks took control of its capital city, Constantinople (modern day Istanbul in Turkey) in AD 1453.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Italy is considered one of the birthplaces of western civilization and a cultural superpower.Italy has been the starting point of phenomena of international impact such as the Roman Empire, the Roman Catholic Church, Romanesque art, the Renaissance, the Scientific revolution,the Baroque, Neoclassicism, the Risorgimento, Fascism and European integration. During its history, the nation has given birth to an enormous number of notable people.</p>
    <br>
	<p>The rebirth of science during the Renaissance brought the daring speculations of Leonardo da Vinci (including discoveries in anatomy, meteorology, geology and hydrology) advances in physics and astronomy by Galileo Galilei, and the development of the barometer by Evangelista Torricelli.At the start of the 20th century, Guglielmo Marconi carried out experiments in electricity and developed the wireless, but he was preceded by Count Alessandro Volta, one of the pioneers of electricity, over 100 years earlier. By the end of the Second World War, Enrico Fermi's work in nuclear physics led to the development of both the atomic bomb and peaceful atomic applications.</p>
